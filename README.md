# UC Fun Kit Game - Group 306
The game that we have created is a game of pong. 
## How to Play
When you boot up the two fun kits, you should see a text screen saying "Choose Player 1". Press the navigational switch on the fun kit you wish to be player one. The other fun kit will be player two. 

Once the game started, each player should have a slider that they can move up and down with the navigational switch. The objective of each player is to defend their goal from the ball with their slider. A player gains a point when the other player fails to defend their goal. The ball will always spawn on player one's screen first.

The game ends when a player scores 3 points. Once this happens, the game will show a text saying whether you won or lost on the respective fun kit.
